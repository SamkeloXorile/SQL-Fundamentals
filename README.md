Practical business use cases (attendance, stock levels, discount eligibility)

Exercise 4 – Joins & Set Operations
INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN
Combining datasets with UNION vs UNION ALL
Filtering join results with conditions

Variances (budget - actual)
Average revenue per customer
